# CourseContentMVC
 Contents of a project I've created as I follow along the course. It was made using ASP.NET version 6.0.

You can simply download the project and run the solution via Visual Studio. This content is meant for me to learn the fundamentals of backend development, database connection for web apps and the MVC pattern. The Interface was paid no attention to.
